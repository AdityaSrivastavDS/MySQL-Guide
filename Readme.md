# MySQL Notes and Practical Implementations

This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing MySQL. It includes detailed notes and practical examples covering a wide range of topics, from basic commands to advanced SQL operations.

## 📚 Contents

### 1. Aggregate Functions
- Learn how to use aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` to summarize data effectively.

### 2. `LIKE` Operation
- Understand the `LIKE` operator for pattern matching in SQL queries.

### 3. Fundamental Commands (DDL, DML)
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Explore commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc., for defining and managing database structures.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Learn commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` for manipulating data.

### 4. Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- Master the use of CTEs for writing modular and reusable SQL queries.

### 5. Views
- Understand how to create and use views to simplify complex SQL queries and enhance reusability.

### 6. Joins
- Explore different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`) to combine data from multiple tables.

### 7. Case Expression
- Learn how to use `CASE` expressions for conditional logic in SQL queries.

### 8. Set Operations
- Dive into set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to combine results from multiple queries.

### 9.Normalization and Denormalization
- Explore database and table optimization.

## 💻 Practical Implementations
Each topic includes hands-on examples and real-world scenarios to help you apply the concepts in practice. These examples are designed to reinforce your understanding and improve your SQL skills.
